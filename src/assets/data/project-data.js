The projects main goal is to evalauate a correlation between complexity of adversarial attacks and complexity of models trained on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). The SNN is trained using backpropagtion. The neural network and adversarial attacks where implemented in python using snnTorch and pyTorch.",
